            <p><u>Role</u>: Secondary Lead Developer, Community Manager</p>
            <p><u>Dates</u>: July 2022 - March 2024</p>
            <p><u>Platform</u>: Unity Game Engine (v.2022)</p>
            <p><i>"A fast-paced online arena FPS with jetpacks, hang gliders, fast respawns, 6-minute rounds and instant matches"</i></p>
            <p>As secondary lead developer, I worked very closely with Alex (the lead developer) to create sophisticated core systems to greatly enhance key aspects of the game. Working with an unofficial contract-based system, the first major piece of code I created was a modular keybind system, the first of its kind to be incorporated around the Unity default Input system.</p>
            <video autoplay loop muted width="400" height="300" name="Keybinds Showcase"><source src="keybinds.mp4"></video>
            <p>After aiding & cooperating on systems such as a sophisticated anit-cheat, reworking aspects of weapon physics & incorporating new cosmetics, I was assigned with creating a set of powerups for the game, including a sticky healing-kit (following the release of team-based modes), a unique radar ability, & more.</p>
            <p>Throughout this coding work, I was also a major member of the Paint warfare socials. I made sure that raids, spam & innapropriate content created on community group chats or comments was removed & punishments were handled accordingly, and I assisted with the creation of content advertising the game.</p><br>
            <p>This was an incredibly fun project which greatly expanded my skills not only with Unity multiplayer, github / version control & C#, but also managing a community & being able to be fluid with the work I complete.</p>

            <h3>Tire Change</h3>
            <p><u>Role</u>: Lead (& only) Developer</p>
            <p><u>Dates</u>: Mid 2022 - Early 2023</p>
            <p><u>Platform</u>: Unity Game Engine (v.2022)</p>
            <p>A super fast-paced offline endless-platformer game with one-finger controls, where the player has to escape the police by drifting on hovering platforms.</p>
            <video autoplay loop muted name="Game Showcase"><source src="tire_change_gameplay.mp4"></video>
            <p class="light-grey-text"><i>NOTE: this was the latest footage i could find, I had greatly improved the AI & incorporated sound effects after this, along with some visual improvements & much better looking levels</i></p>
            <p>Featuring low poly, colourful visuals, it was a great project to get a grasp at making a full game in unity. Fully solo, I had to make UI, develop every core script, balance colours to create a unique stylised look, experiment with particles & ai for the first time, and learn how to get it all working on mobile.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, it isn't on any app store as my computer bricked with all of the old files on it :(. Nevertheless, it was a fun side project to learn the basics of mobile game development, monetisation, design & more.</p>
